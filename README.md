# Sherpa AI Box

Enhance your development workflow with AI-powered tools.

This extension is a collection of tools that use AI to help to automate tedious
tasks in the development workflow.

Currently, it uses locally running AI models to avoid privacy issues caused by
sending data to third-party servers.

## Features

for grammar mistakes in the text.

Run "Fix Grammar" from the command palette.
